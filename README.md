# Protein Function Annotations in Three Ways

## About:

Do my novel chemical compounds and/or proteomics method... 
1. enrich a set of particular structural domains and functional pathways?
2. access a new "druggable" space?
3. target important classes of "undruggable" proteins?

## Setup:
1. Particular modules necessary to run each script or notebook are listed in the setup section of each README. 
2. Input files <compiled_proteins.csv> are required and can be obtained from the MS-CpDAA Analysis Suite.
3. Additional files listing specific UniProtKB accession identifiers can also be utilized as input.
4. UniProtKB files and Human Protein Atlas files need to be downloaded with the provided links and required columns listed in each individual setup section.
5. Additional input files are provided in the accompanying data folders.

## Usage:
1. Custom gene set enrichment
2. Protein druggability annotations
3. Protein function classifications
